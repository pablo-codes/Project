## Author's Note

- The basis of the code is the server the client is just showing how the data can be rendered
- If error is detected,please send me an email
- Pls note that another user can't see your topics only the ADMIN has rights
- If no user you will be redirected to register
- Admin credentials are in the .env file (feel free to change them )
- The admin must be created (i.e /register) with the specific credentials
- Make sure you create a user before you enter the client
- A Topic/Image must be created before the all topics/images page renders
- Click on the Blog system logo at the uppermost left of the page to Login/Register
- React should run on port 3000 (if you feel the need to change, change it on the CORS also)
- If there is any error pls check the console
