## Author's Note

- The basis of the code is the server the client is just showing how the data can be rendered
- If error detected, email me
- Pls note that another user can't see your topics only the ADMIN has rights
- If no user you will be redirected to register
- Admin credentials are in the .env file
- NB: the admin must be created with the specific credentials, feel free to change them (i.e Register-user)
- Make sure you create a user before you enter the client
- Click on the Blog system logo at the uppermost left of the page Login/Register
- If error check console
